Monetization UX Breadboard (Pricing and Flow Sketch)

- Phase: MVP Checkout flow using Stripe Checkout for all price points.
- Pages:
  - Pricing page with 4 items: Monthly, Annual, The Manual (27), Basic Report (5), Two-User Report (7)
  - Purchase actions trigger Stripe Checkout jS API and then redirect back to app with success URL
- Post-purchase: grant access to digital report and present download link
- Accessibility and brutalist visuals: sharp borders, no shadows, tabular figures in data tables
