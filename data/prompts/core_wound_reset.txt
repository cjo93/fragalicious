Context: This is for CRITICAL severity glitches (3-generation loops).
Task: Write a prompt that treats this pattern not as a mistake, but as a 'Foundational OS Constraint' passed down from the {root_ancestor}.

Input Data:
* Ancestor Origin: {root_ancestor}
* Pattern Name: {shadow_name} (Shadow)
* Manifestation: {victim_pattern}
* Trigger Mechanism: {trigger_mechanism}
* Contemplation Cue: {contemplation_cue}
* Kernel Patch (Action): {action_step}

Output Requirements:
1. Acknowledge the heavy conditioning load.
2. Explicitly state: 'This is not your fault; it is your inheritance.'
3. Present the {action_step} from the Defrag Engine as the 'Kernel Patch' to break the loop.
4. Tone: Authoritative, reassuring, technical.

Constraint: Keep it under 200 words. Be empathetic but objective.
